    <h1>Log #268</h1>
    <h3>6/14/25</h3>
    <p>Today I woke up later then normal. I had fun last night with my friends. I had the same breakfast. I was alone for most of the day. I was playing with ____ for most of the morning. We played some forklift and mexican game, it was fun. I then did my chores but skipped out on lunch. I need to stop eating before I end up fat. I watched youtube on my tv but started to freak out, I dont know why. ____ helped me tho, im greatful to have her as a friend. The rest of the day until the end was uneventful. i dont want to talk about the end.</p>
