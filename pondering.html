    <p>I endure, not out of hope,</p>
    <p>but because my fate is chained to another.</p>
    <p>We are two bound by consequence,</p>
    <p>tethered like stones in a sinking river-</p>
    <p>if one sinks, the other is pulled under.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They do not wish for my end.</p>
    <p>Their voice, quiet but certain, calls me back from the edge.</p>
    <p>Not love nor lust</p>
    <p>But a bond forged in shared despair. And fear-</p>
    <p>fear of what would follow if I were gone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yet even as they beg me to remain,</p>
    <p>their path winds toward death.</p>
    <p>Each step they take, knowingly or not,</p>
    <p>cuts the thread that holds us both.</p>
    <p>They do not see it.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps they do,</p>
    <p>but cannot stop the motion.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Still, I remain.</p>
    <p>Not for joy. Not for peace.</p>
    <p>But because they are the last post holding up the structure.</p>
    <p>And if they fall,</p>
    <p>the whole crumbles with them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I stand in the shadow of their undoing,</p>
    <p>held back by duty,</p>
    <p>bound by shared consequence,</p>
    <p style="color: red;">waiting to see which of us breaks first.</p>
