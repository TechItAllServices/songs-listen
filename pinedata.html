  <h2>DESIGNATION: <span class="highlight">PINE</span></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>DATA:</h2>
    <p>Pine didn’t start evil. That’s what makes it worse. Once a forgettable nobody scraping through Hell’s lower levels, he found the Company—and something in him <em>snapped</em>. Not all monsters are born. Some are <strong>promoted</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now the right hand of Red, Pine serves as his personal enforcer, informant, and butcher. His rage is not mindless; it is deliberate. Refined. Targeted. And it burns hotter than Hell’s fire, because it’s fed by failure.</p>
    <p>Pine’s past is a trail of broken relationships and personal catastrophes, all connected by one name: the Company.</p>
    <p>His first partner was consumed—swallowed by Company experiments. His second tried to escape through death, only to be reanimated and reassigned. His third? She rebelled and became what he hates most: a <strong>Solver</strong>. Now, she stands in opposition to everything he’s become. Every blow he strikes is an echo of a love turned into loathing.</p>
    <p>Unlike Red, Pine doesn’t wear the brand with pride. He drags it like a chain. And though he plays the obedient dog, his leash is frayed with resentment. But revenge drives him harder than regret ever could. He doesn’t just want to serve. He wants to <strong>erase</strong>.</p>
    <p>To him, every Solver is a betrayal made manifest. And he will kill them all—starting with the one who broke him.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>STRATEGY:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely aggressive and cocky at first—but loses composure the longer the fight drags on.</li>
      <li>Taunting or referencing past emotional trauma (through dialogue or actions) enrages him, opening critical strike windows.</li>
      <li>Often delays healing or defense, too fixated on offense—punish this recklessness.</li>
      <li>Will go berserk if you stall too long, unleashing a savage chain of attacks that leave him stunned if dodged successfully.</li>
      <li>Pine stores emotional energy—he doesn't explode immediately, but when he does, it’s devastating. Watch for subtle animation tells.</li>
      <li>Can enter "Ruin State" after taking significant emotional damage—temporarily increases his power, but his movements become erratic and easy to counter.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section note">
    <p>NOTES:</p>
    <p>None.</p>
    <!-- <p>Pine is not just angry. He is <strong>wounded</strong>. And the wound is festering.</p>
    <p>He fights like he has nothing left. Because in his mind, he doesn’t.</p> -->
