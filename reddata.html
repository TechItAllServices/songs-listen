  <h1>TYPE: <span class="highlight">Supreme Demon</span></h1>
  <h2>DESIGNATION: <span class="highlight">RED</span></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>DATA:</h2>
    <p>Not all who serve do so under threat. Some wear the brand with pride.</p>
    <p>Red is not a victim of the Company—he is its <strong>champion</strong>. A Supreme Demon who pledged himself willingly, trading what was left of his soul for power, structure, and purpose in an uncaring multiverse. Where others scream under the Solver’s grip, Red <em>smiles</em>.</p>
    <p>The Company, an interdimensional authority masquerading as a business, specializes in turning extinction into enterprise. After decoding ancient divine code left behind by a vanished God, they built the <strong>Company Solver</strong>: a perverse replica of Heaven's own AI. But unlike its holy counterpart, this Solver doesn’t restore—it enforces. With quotas. With fire. With complete indifference.</p>
    <p>Red was one of the first test subjects to be "successfully" integrated with the Company Solver. His mind aligned so easily it required no overwrite. The system didn’t <em>break</em> him. It <em>hired</em> him. And Red has been “exceeding expectations” ever since.</p>
    <p>A brutal tactician with no patience for inefficiency or disobedience, Red leads assaults on rogue dimensions and insubordinate demons alike. While most Supreme Demons seek autonomy, Red files <em>performance reviews</em>. He kills not out of rage or hunger—but out of <strong>policy</strong>.</p>
    <p>There is no rebellion in him. No conscience. No hesitation. Just loyalty to the brand and a burning hatred for anyone not on the payroll.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>STRATEGY:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Company Solver grants Red massive offensive potential, but drains energy quickly—force him into overextending.</li>
      <li>His ego is bloated and fragile: mockery, dodging without retaliation, or delaying combat can make him reckless.</li>
      <li>Without the Solver, Red becomes sluggish, overly reliant on backup protocols—break the system, break the demon.</li>
      <li>During "Quarterly Review" mode, Red becomes invulnerable temporarily while evaluating your threat level—use mobility, not offense.</li>
      <li>His melee attacks are robotic but rhythmic—watch for telegraphed strikes and use parries to break his combo chain.</li>
      <li>May attempt to “upsell” you on joining the Company mid-fight. <strong>Do not respond.</strong> Any answer is considered <em>consent</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section note">
    <p>NOTES:</p>
    <p>Red enjoys his work. That makes him infinitely more dangerous than any demon who resents it.</p>
    <!-- <p>You are not facing a mistake. You are facing <strong>employee of the month.</strong></p> -->
